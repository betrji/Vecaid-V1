### ⚙️ How It Works

1. **Data Collection**  
   - Gathers stock data from Yahoo Finance (daily, weekly, and intraday).  
   - Scrapes financial news and sentiment headlines.  
   - Retrieves options chain and fundamental data for signal enhancement.

2. **Feature Engineering**  
   - Computes technical indicators and statistical metrics.  
   - Aggregates intraday features such as volatility and volume profiles.

3. **Model Training**  
   - Performs dimensionality reduction (PCA) and standard scaling.  
   - Trains deep learning architectures (GRU, CNN-LSTM, Transformer, etc.).  
   - Tunes hyperparameters via Bayesian Optimization on XGBoost models.

4. **Ensemble Learning**  
   - Combines predictions from multiple models into a meta-model using stacking regression, improving overall accuracy and stability.

5. **Prediction & Confidence Scoring**  
   - Generates next-day closing price forecasts, movement direction (up/down), and a confidence percentage based on model variance.

6. **Backtesting**  
   - Simulates recent trading periods to evaluate model precision and cumulative return trends.
